# 
Hello! I am a first year PhD student in the Department of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins University. Before coming to Johns Hopkins, I graduated from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) with a bachelor's degree in statistics. My research interests include health disparities research and causual inference, and am hoping to explore both in greater detail.

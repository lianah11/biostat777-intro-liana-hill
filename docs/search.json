    "text": "Statistical meta-analysis is a method used across studies to systematically combine and analyze data from multiple studies on a particular topic. Oftentimes, researchers encounter conflicting results across studies, i.e. a finding that appears statistically significant in one study but lacks significance in another. This variance could stem from differences in study designs, sample characteristics, or many other factors. Through meta-analysis, we can navigate through conflicting results, derive more reliable conclusions about the relationships between variables, and systematic approach to interpret this variability in findings across studies.\nIn this report, we will practice meta-analysis using a dataset from the metadat package in R. This dataset contains 102 studies that examined the effects of elevated CO2 levels in woody plant mass by comparing above and below-ground biomass (measured in grams) of plants exposed to ambient CO2 levels (control group) versus elevated CO2 levels (treatment group)."

This indicates the random effects model would suit our data better. Additionally, the standardized mean difference (SMD) between treatment groups is sstatistically signficant, as the confidence interval for the SMD does not contain 0. Additionally, the estimated between-study variance is quantified at 0.3756, meaning the difference and 52% of the total variability in our SMD is due to the between study variability (heterogeniety).\nThe forest function allows us to see the results of our statistical meta-analysis through a plot. We can see the output below.\n\nforest(SMD_results)"

This can give us an idea of how many studies reported a signficant difference in biomasses for plants given elevated CO2. Based on the plot below, we see the confidence intervals of more than our studies contain 0, meaning there is not a statistically signficant relationship between the CO2 levels and plant bimass. However, despite this, the overall difference across all the studies combined is significant due to the weight of each studies.\n\n# making data frame of confidence intervals\nci_dat &lt;- effect_size_dat %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    se = sqrt(vi),\n    ci_lo = yi - 1.96 * se,\n    ci_hi = yi + 1.96 * se,\n    study_id = row_number()\n  )\n\nggplot(ci_dat, aes(x = study_id, y = yi, ymin = ci_lo, ymax = ci_hi)) +\n  geom_pointrange() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Effect Sizes of Each Study with 95% CIs\",\n    subtitle = \"True Effect Size is SMD = 0\",\n    x = \"Study index\",\n    y = \"Standardized Mean Difference (yi)\",\n    caption = \"CIs computed as yi ± 1.96*SE where yi = SMD of study\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThere are some additional meta-analysis tools that can be used such as meta-regression, and using Egger’s regression test to quantify potential publication bias.
